# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
####
A business proposal to create an ice cream and surf shop combination has been pitched to an enthusiastic backer. However, the potential backer has requested a data analysis of the weather on Oahu, Hawaii to determine if this combination shop is truly feasible. An overarching analysis has been presented already, but the backer has now requested a specific look at temperatures in the peek of winter and summer. The months of June and December have been selected to show the historical averages of a peek and slow season through the years. Using Python code, Jupyter Notebook, and SQLite, queries are created and then saved to dataframes in order to analyze the weather data using summary statistics for the sustainability of the potential business venture. 

## Results
####
Below are the results from the two queries: 

* The average temperature in June is roughly 75 degrees, four degrees higher than the average temperature in December. 
* December has about 200 less data points than the month of June, meaning the two months do not have the same amount of data to pull from.
* The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, which is eight degrees lower than the minimum temperatures in June. 
* Both months share a rough standard deviation of roughly 3, meaning the data falls within a normal, reliable distribution.
